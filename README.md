This application runs UNTRUSTED CODE generated by ChatGPT. While it doesn't seem particularly likely that the code is going to do anything super silly, I can't guarantee that it won't.  
As such, exercise EXTREME CAUTION if you decide to use this app. If you intend on doing so:
1) Deploy Forge endpoints in `backend` with `forge deploy` (See Forge ML docs for more info)
2) `cd backend && npm start`
3) `cd frontend && npm run dev`
4) `backend/gen-rule.sh` to generate a new rule file
5) Modify `current-rule.txt` to contain the UUID (filename sans extension) of the rule from `backend/rules` you wish to use
